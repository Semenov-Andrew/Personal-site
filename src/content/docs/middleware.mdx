    The text below is from the [Tailwind
    CSS](https://play.tailwindcss.com/uj1vGACRJA?layout=preview) docs. I copied
    it here to test the markdown styles. **Tailwind is awesome. You should use
    it.**

    <h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
    <p>
        For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic
        bread with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an
        iconic status in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm,
        cheesy loaf for Halloween.

        But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to
        a series of rabies cases springing up around the country.

## There are other elements we need to style

I almost forgot to mention links, like [this link to the Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com). We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with dark gray, feels edgier.

We even included table styles, check it out:
